# calculate-cn-node

A node script that could find chinese string in your project

## Usage

1. Use `npm install`
2. Use `node index.js` command

## Note

The disadvantage of this script is that it cannot make Chinese text form a word.
If you want to solve this problem, maybe search about `nodejieba` registry etc.

## TODO

- [x] Consider multiple annotations
- [ ] Optimize word segmentation ability
